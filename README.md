# FrostWing Hardware Solutions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hello!

This website is just a project for an online course I am doing. Needless to mention that FrostWing is not a real company and that attempting to purchase any products featured within the website will not work. Hope you like it!

Cheers!
